How to Build a Resume-Based Job Suggestion App with Generative AI

Introduction

Finding the right job can be daunting for job seekers and a challenging process for recruiters seeking suitable candidates. By leveraging Generative AI and cloud technologies, we can build a smart, resume-based job suggestion app to simplify and enhance the job-matching experience.
This blog is for individuals with beginner to intermediate coding knowledge interested in understanding how AI-powered applications work. By the end of this blog, you will have the skills to build a simple web application that uses AI to analyze resumes and suggest relevant job titles and descriptions.
Design
Our application focuses on usability, accuracy, and scalability. The high-level architecture of the solution involves:
Frontend: A user-friendly interface for uploading resumes (PDF) and displaying job suggestions.
Backend: A Flask-based API to process resumes and communicate with the Generative AI model for job suggestions.
AI Integration: Google Cloud's Generative AI model (Gemini) to analyze resumes and generate job suggestions.


Prerequisites

Programming Languages: Python (for backend) and basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for frontend).
Libraries and Frameworks:
Flask
Google Cloud AI Platform SDK (google-cloud-aiplatform)
Flask-CORS

Tools:
Python 3.8+ 
 IDE like VSCode 
Google Cloud SDK 
Google Cloud Account with access to Generative AI (Gemini).


Step-by-step Instructions


Install Python and ensure it's added to your PATH.
Install necessary libraries.
Set up Google Cloud SDK and authenticate.
Create the flask api for backend development.
Create front end development.
Integrate Google Cloud's Generative AI in your backend to replace the placeholder suggestions.

Result / Demo

At the end of this project, users will experience a fully functional Resume-Based Job Suggestion App. Here's what you'll see and how it effectively communicates results:
User Interaction
Frontend:
The user can paste their resume text or upload a PDF. Upon submitting, the app processes the resume and displays a list of job suggestions tailored to the user's skills and experience.
Backend:
The backend uses AI to analyze the resume text, matches it with job descriptions, and provides relevant job titles and descriptions.
What's Next?
To enhance our model:
Add a database to store user profiles and suggestions.
Integrate more advanced AI models for improved suggestions.
Deploy the app using Google Cloud App Engine for scalability.
